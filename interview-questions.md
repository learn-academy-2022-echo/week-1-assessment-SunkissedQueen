# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: evaluates true or false conditions and give an output

Researched answer:
Recommended ---> I have used conditional statements as a student. One challenge asked to assign a letter to a grade percentage. Using conditionals were very helpful. Conditionals have a code block that runs after a true condition has been met. For example, if I wanted a letter "A" to be produced, I can set up a condition that sets up the grade percentage >=93 with a code block to return A.

Plagiarism ---> Copy/paste from website 
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
From Developer Joyce
Researched answer: Git is something that I am very familiar with as I use it on a daily basis when I am coding. Git, which is also known as the Global Information Tracker, is an opened-sourced version control system that is used within the developer space. This is a tool which is used by developers to work on the same code, share code, and write code for the same main code base. Git is a system that can be accessed through the terminal of your local machine.
GitHub is a website that anyone can access where it allows for code to be stored within their platform. This allows for collaboration between developers because you can have direct access to a main code base from anywhere.
The difference between Git and Github is that Git is located within your local machine through the terminal and it allows you to work on code remotely and upload it to a place like GitHub which stores the code for anyone to access.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
From Developer Kelly
Researched answer:
A Boolean value is true or false, and the operators == (loosely equal), === (strictly equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or qual to), < (less than), <= (less than or qual to), !== (strictly not equal) will return a Boolean value.
There is also the != (loosely not equal) operator. We can combine conditions using these operators with && (AND) and || (OR). With &&, both conditions must be true for it to be true. With ||, one condition must be true for it to be true.

Equality
Relational
Logical

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:
From Developer Cody
Researched answer:
Index is the location of a value starting from 0.  The difference between an index and a value is that an index is the location of a value while the value is the type of data at that index.

4. What is iteration?
From Web Developer Samuel
Your answer: Iteration is in a loop, whenever you have to do something multiple times to get a result. 

Researched answer: Iteration is when a process in repeated multiple times. This comes in handy when we use loops, as the goal of those is to have many processes happen without us having to repeatedly run them over and over again. An example of this would be in the loop
    const num = 1
    for(let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        return (num[i]) 
    }
The loop is repeatedly checking over and over again until it reaches 20, so that I don't have to write it 20 times to get the same result.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
From Developer Clifford
Researched answer:
Pair programming is the act of multiple developers working on a project together and taking turns and doing different parts. The technique that I use at Learn is the "driver and Navigator" technique. The concept is that if there were 2 people, one person would be a driver and the other a navigator, and after a certain amount of time, they would us git to share the work that was done and switch roles. The driver would share their screen and  be the person typing the code, where as the navigator would be watching the drivers screen and possibly have another window open doing research and instructing the Driver. Both parties talk and can discuss the possible plans of attack. Depending on the parties skill levels the jobs of both parties could be more or less hands off. For example, the task is to make a basic website and the pair were given a template and design sheet. A pair beginner developers could be staying together and going line for line and working through the code. Where as if it was a pair of more senior Developers, The driver could start knocking out the html framework while the navigator is looking for the colors of fonts and getting image links and other things like that prepared so when the driver gets to needing that kind of stuff the navigator can just say something like, font size for the heading is 54px color is (124, 15, 0), and so on.
