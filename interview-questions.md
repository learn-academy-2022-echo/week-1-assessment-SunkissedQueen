# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Researched answer:
Recommended ---> I have used conditional statements as a student. One challenge asked to assign a letter to a grade percentage. Using conditionals were very helpful. Conditionals have a code block that runs after a true condition has been met. For example, if I wanted a letter "A" to be produced, I can set up a condition that sets up the grade percentage >=93 with a code block to return A.

Plagiarism ---> Copy/paste from website 
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
